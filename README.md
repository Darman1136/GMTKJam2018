# GMTKJam2018

Hello, there! Welcome to the GMTK 2018 (48h)!

This is my short little entry into this years game jam.
A platformer without running or jumping. All you got is your trusty rifle, with an upgraded secondary fire mode. Have fun!

Controls:
Left Mouse Button    -> Fire primary
Right Mouse Button -> Fire secondary
Escape                       -> Return to menu

Thanks for playing! Your feedback is appreciated!
